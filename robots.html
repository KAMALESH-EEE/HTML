        <h2>Host Controller and Main Frame</h2>
        <p>It provides base support to robot.<br>
            It is combination of Mechanical and Electrical System.<br>
            All other modules are connected to it.<br>
            It consist of RP2040 micro controller and main aluminium frame.<br>
            Its mechanical design will look like rover which will make it to perform in rough land.<br>

        <h2>Driving System</h2>
        <p> It provides the mechanical moments to robot on land.<br>
            It consists of 4 DC Motors and 2 Servo Motors to move Forward, Reverse, turn left and right.<br>
            It is attached in bottom of robot and electrically connected to driver circuit which can be controlled by controllers.<br>

        <h2>Sensor Module</h2>
        <p>
            It consists of multiple sensors like Humility, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, ultrasonic sensors, IR sensor, soil moisture sensor.
            Those sensors collect the data from field and send it to local controller.
            The local controller process the data and store the information.
            It will send the information when the host controller acknowledge it.
            The host controller takes decision according to the information.
